# ai-childrens-books
ai-childrens-books is a tool that uses GPT-3 to generate ideas and text for children's books.

## Installation
To install ai-childrens-books, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supervised/ai-childrens-books.git
cd ai-childrens-books
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need to obtain an API key for the OpenAI GPT-3 library.

## Usage
To use ai-childrens-books, import the `book` module and call the `ideas` and/or `write` functions:

```python
import book

# Generate ideas for a children's book about unicorns
book.ideas(concept="unicorns", age=5, save="unicorn_ideas.txt")

# Generate text for a children's book about unicorns
book.write(concept="unicorns", age=5, save="unicorn_book.txt")
```

The ideas function generates ideas for a children's book from the concept input. The write function generates the text for a children's book from the concept input. The age option specifies the age of the reader. The save option is optional, and allows the user to save the output to a file. The other options are used by GPT-3 to control the generation.

## Options
The `ideas` and `write` functions accept the following options:

- `concept` (required): The concept for the children's book.
- `age`: The age of the intended reader.
- `temperature`: The temperature to use for sampling. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens (words and word pieces) to generate in the prompt.
- `top_p`: Controls the proportion of the mass of the distribution to be included in the top_p mass of the sorted list of candidates. If top_p is 1, then the model will always select the most likely token. If top_p < 1, then the model will consider a subset of the sorted list.
- `frequency_penalty`: Controls the relative importance of frequency of appearance and novelty. If frequency_penalty is 0, then the model will prefer novel tokens. If frequency_penalty is > 0, then the model will penalize novel tokens.
- `presence_penalty`: Controls the relative importance of presence in the prompt and absence. If presence_penalty is 0, then the model will prefer tokens that are not present in the prompt. If presence_penalty is > 0, then the model will penalize tokens that are not present in the prompt.
- `best_of`: The number of top candidates to consider for each token. Higher values means slower decoding and higher quality.
- `save (optional)`: The name of the file to save the output to. If not provided, the output will be printed to the console.
